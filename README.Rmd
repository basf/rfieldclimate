An R client for [Fieldclimate API](https://api.fieldclimate.com/v2/docs/)

## Installation

```r
remotes::install_github("basf/rfieldclimate")
```

## Examples

```{r load, eval=FALSE}
library("rfieldclimate")
```

```{r load2, include=FALSE}
library("rfieldclimate", lib.loc = "~/R/packages")
```


### Authentication

`rfieldclimate` uses [HMAC](https://api.fieldclimate.com/v2/docs/#authentication-hmac) for authentication.

The public and private keys are read by default from environmental variables
`FC_PUBLIC_KEY` and `FC_PRIVATE_KEY`, but you can provide them also in every function call
using the `public_key=` and `private_key=` arguments.


### Basic use

`fc_request()` is the workhorse of this package. 

With it you can query every API endpoint, e.g.

```{r request, eval=FALSE}
fc_request(method = "GET", path = "/system/types") %>%
  head(2)
```
See the `Routes` tables [API documentation](https://api.fieldclimate.com/v2/docs/#system) for details.
URL parameters must be included in the `path=` arguments, the request body in `body=`.


## Wrappers

With `fc_request()` all the api functionality can be easily covered. 
Additionally, we provide some wrappers around endpoints.

E.g. the wrapper for station information (see below) is defined as


```{r}
fc_get_station
```



For a few other endpoints wrapper functions are provided: 

* `fc_get_user()` to list user information
* `fc_get_user_stations()` to list available stations
* `fc_get_station()` to get station information
* `fc_get_data()` to get data range of a station
* `fc_get_data_range()` to get data in range

Feel free to add more wrappers (as described above).

## Parsers

We provide also convenience wrappers for objects, like

* `fc_parse_data()` to parse the object returned by `fc_get_data_range()` into a
  long format data.frame
* `fc_parse_stations()` to parse the object returned by `fc_get_user_stations()` 
  into a data.frame

## Unit tests

To run the full test suite with 100% coverage set valid environmental variables
`FC_PUBLIC_KEY` and `FC_PRIVATE_KEY` and run `devtools::test()`.
